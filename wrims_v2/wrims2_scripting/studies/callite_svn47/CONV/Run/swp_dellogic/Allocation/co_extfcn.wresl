!Define external function for allocating Article 56 carryover.

!The call to the external function is either:

!1.	A56_Allocation(1, contractor_number, TableA_1, co_req_1, TableA_2, co_req_2,...,TableA_30, co_req_30)
!For which the result will be the specified contractor's carryover allocation fraction for the available carrover 
!at that timestep. Entering "1" means calculate new allocation with given input.

!2.	A56_Allocation(0, contractor_number)
!This will provide the same result but use previously calculated allocations so that you don't have to recalculate for each contractor.
!Entering "0" means grab the previously calculated value for specified contractor.

define A56_Allocation {EXTERNAL f90}
