! what is the constraint for dvar x?

SEQUENCE CYCLE1 {
    model   first
    order   1
    }

SEQUENCE CYCLE2 {
    model   second
    order   2
    }	
	
MODEL first { 

	define[local] x { std kind 'cycle1_local' units 'CFS' } 
	goal[local] goal_1 { x < 844 }
}

MODEL second { 

	goal[local] goal_1 { x < 99 }
	
		Objective obj = {
		[x, 100]
	}
}
