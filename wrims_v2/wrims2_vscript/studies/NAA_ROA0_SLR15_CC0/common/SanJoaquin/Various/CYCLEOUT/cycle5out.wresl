/*
Cycle 5
The following WRESL code is used in cycle 6 to write out intermediate solver computations
that are made in the SJR module.  This may be needed to verify output computations that
are based on cycle5 because the final output is the monthly weighted flows and storages,
not what may be in each 10, 14, 15, or 16 day period.
