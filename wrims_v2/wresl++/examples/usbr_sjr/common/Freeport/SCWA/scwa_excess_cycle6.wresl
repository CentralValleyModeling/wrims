!Sets up Requested Diversions from Freeport for Sacramento County
!This information is based on correspondance with Tad Berkebile at SacCo as of Jan 2002

!priorities:
!1)  cvp Freeport at meets Freeport demands
!2)  Excess at Freeport meets total demands unmet by sum of 
!    cvp freeport and SCWA Fazio .  This logic nees to be in cycle 7

!Excess taken as last priority (i.e. below wheeling, and interruptibles)
!Unmet shortage calculated for post-processing at node 305)

!In cycle 6 no excess is taken since wheeling is modeled in cycle 7
