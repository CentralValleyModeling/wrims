<P>Derived and Multiple Time Series are organized through a tree in the DTS Tree Tab. The tree uses folder and terminal nodes to organize the DTS and MTS’s created. The structure of the tree and the DTS and MTS definitions in the tree are stored in a <i>.tree</i> file that is generally saved in the same directory as the project file. If a project is saved, the tree path and name of the tree file are saved in the project file. When the project is reopened the tree file will automatically be accessed and the tree will be generated.</P>
