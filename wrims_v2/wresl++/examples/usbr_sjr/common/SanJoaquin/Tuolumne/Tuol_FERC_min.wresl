! This code calculates the FERC minimum flows on the Tuolumne River


/*
The FERC minimum flows are read as timeseries inputs based on pre-processed
hydrology. According to documentation, to ensure a minimum through
throughout the Tuolumne River, it is necessary to impose this requirement on
reaches C_TUO054, C542, and C544. However, in this code the requirement is not
imposed on C542 and C544.  Why?????????????
