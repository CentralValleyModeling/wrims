                                short pause times and limit the total number of
                                those pauses within a prescribed window (this

    -Xms<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]
              sets the initial Java heap size (ms)
                  server mode:  the default value is 25% of the amount 
				of free physical memory in the system 
				up to 64 MB with a minimum of 8 MB (default)
                  client mode:  the default value is 25% of the amount 
				of free physical memory in the system 
				up to 16 MB with a minimum of 8 MB
    -Xmx<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]
	      sets the maximum Java heap size (mx)
                  server mode:  the default value is the smallest of 75% of
                       		physical memory and 1536 MB (default)
                  client mode: 	the default value is the smallest of 75% of
				physical memory and 64 MB              
    -Xns<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]
	      sets the initial Java nursery size for generational collectors
                  server mode:  the default value is dynamic (throughput
                                prio and genpar gc) or 10 MB per hardware
                                thread (pausetime prio and gencon gc)
                  client mode:  the default value is 2 MB            
    -Xss<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]
              set initial stack size
    -Xpausetarget=<optimal_pause_time>[ms|s]
              JRockit will optimize the pause time to the given target,
              uses -Xgcprio:pausetime
                  ms            pause time specified in milliseconds (default)
                  s             pause time specified in seconds
    -Xnoclassgc

              JRockit will not process CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT or SIGHUP events
    -Xverbose[:memory|load|jni|cpuinfo|codegen|opt|gcpause|gcreport]
              Enables verbose output. These are only a few of the 
              available log modules. For more information on log 
              modules refer to the documentation.
