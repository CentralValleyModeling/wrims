!! Code by E.Reyes     as of  3/22/99
!! Revised by SRS      as of 12/21/99
!! Further revised by Nancy Parker 4/6/01
!!!  Code for CVP(PROSIM) type lookup tables for minflow on the American below Nimbus.
!!!  Code for American River Operations based on "modified D-1400"
!!!  Minflow below Nimbus(CP 41) is set according to a CVP Lookup Table that looks at
!!!  combinations Folsom storage and forecasted inflows and demands (see table below for trigger description).
!!!  The minflow must also meet Stability criteria.  The November - March minflows must be at least 80% of the
!!!  preceding month's flow.  If the preceding month's flow exceeds a stability limit, then the stability
!!!  criteria is ignored.


! How Trigger is determined.
