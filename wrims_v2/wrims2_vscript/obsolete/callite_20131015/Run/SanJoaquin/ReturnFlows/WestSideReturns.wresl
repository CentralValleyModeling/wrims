! File for calculating Westside return flows

/*
The following code calculates return flows on the West-side

Some CVP contractor diversions have return flows to the San Joaquin. Each
delivery node is essentially a total comprised of multiple individual
contractors, each of which have different return flow locations and
properties.  This code proportions the return flow influence by diversion
node, return node, and contractor. The return flow factor will be:

[(Individual contract amt * % of that amount returning to a particular node)
 / Total annual contract at the delivery node] * monthly return flow % for
 the individual contractor

Each return flow factor is applied to the total delivery to get a set of
return flows by individual contractor to several return flow locations.


Refuge returns are handled differently since they happen on an annual pattern
which is not the same as the delivery pattern.  Since we cannot assume full
deliveries, the return will be based on the actual delivery of the previous
12 months.  It is assumed that X% of the annual delivery is returned to the
system on a pattern in the lookup Table.

**************************Refuge Return Flows********************************
*/

/*
Annual Lower DMC refuge returns to SJR at Salt Slough are assumed to be 61% (changed from 30%)
of the contract year allocation.  The fraction of 61% is applied to both D708 and D_MDOTAC to
produce an aggregate annual refuge return of ~= 120 TAF of operations' returns and ~50TAF of
"pass-through" returns (WETMANSIM-031604_ver01.00).

In CALSIM, Level 2 refuge deliveries are embedded in D708 and D_MDOTAC, which represent more than
just Firm Level 2 delivery (~277 TAF); Level 2 is actually 219TAF.  So 0.61 doesn’t represent a true refuge
return factor.  Instead it is a fitting factor applied to CALSIM’s "refuge + other" delivery amounts in D708 + D_MDOTAC.

In the future, D708 and D_MDOTAC should be disaggregated to isolate Firm Level 2 delivery.
The return fraction should then be modified while preserving the target annual return volume
of 120TAF for refuge operations and 50TAF for passthrough operations.

This representation of refuge return quantities does not reflect:
-- Level 4 refuge supplies and operational effects
-- operational adjustments when Level 2 supplies are based on "<100%" CVP allocation
