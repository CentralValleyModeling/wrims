-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 2.0 (as compared to version 1.2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added CPP grammar to examples directory (contributed by Malome Khomo).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

GUI is now available to run JavaCC.  You can control all aspects of
JJTree and JavaCC (except creating and editing the grammar file)
through this GUI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Desktop icons now available on a variety of platforms so you can
run JavaCC by double clicking the icon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Bash on NT support improved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Uninstaller included.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed some minor bugs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 1.2 (as compared to version 1.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved JavaCC to the Metamata installer and made it available for
download from Metamata's web site.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added Java 1.2 grammars to the examples directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added repetition range specifications for regular expressions.
You can specify exact number of times a particular re should
occur or a {man, max} range, e.g,

    TOKEN:
    {
         < TLA: (["A"-"Z"]){3} > // Three letter acronyms!

      |

         < DOS_FILENAME: (~[".", ":", ";", "\\"]) {1,8}
                         ( "." (~[".", ":", ";", "\\"]){1,3})? >
               // An incomplete spec for the DOS file name format
    }

The translation is right now expanding out these many number of times
so use it with caution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now specify actions/state changes for EOF. It is right now
very strict in that it has to look exactly like:

   <*> TOKEN:
   {
      < EOF > { action } : NEW_STATE
   }

which means that EOF is still EOF in every state except that now
you can specify what state changes  if any or what java code
if any to execute on seeing EOF.

This should help in writing grammars for processing C/C++ #include
files, without going through hoops as in the old versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 1.0 (as compared to version 0.8pre2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed bugs related to usage of JavaCC with Java 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many other bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.8pre2 (as compared to version 0.8pre1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mainly bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.8pre1 (as compared to version 0.7.1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed all references to Stream classes in the JavaCC code itself and
changed them to Reader/Writer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed all the generated *CharStream classes to use Reader instead of
InputStream. The names of the generated classes still say *CharStream.
For compatibility reasons, the old constructors are still supported.
All the constructors that take InputStream create InputStreamReader
objects for reading the input data. All users parsing non-ASCII inputs
should continue to use the InputStream constrctors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate inner classes instead of top level classes where appropriate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7.1 (as compared to version 0.7)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the handling of empty PARSER_BEGIN...PARSER_END
regions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in Java1.1noLA.jj - the improved performance Java grammar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a spurious definition that was being generated into the parser
when USER_TOKEN_MANAGER was set to true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7 (as compared to version 0.7pre7)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the error reporting routines to delete duplicate entries from
the "expected" list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Generated braces around the "if (true) ..." construct inserted
by JavaCC to prevent the dangling else problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added code to consume_token that performs garbage collections of
tokens no longer necessary for error reporting purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug with OPTIMIZE_TOKEN_MANAGER when there is a commmon prefix
for two or more (complex) regular expressions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a JJTree bug where a node annotation #P() caused a null pointer
error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Only generate the jjtCreate() methods if the NODE_FACTORY option is
set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug where the name of the JJTree state file was being used in
the declaration of the field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated the performance page to demonstrate how JavaCC performance
has improved since Version 0.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre7 (as compared to version 0.7pre6)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added an option CACHE_TOKENS with a default value of false.  You
can generate slightly faster and (it so happens) more compact
parsers if you set CACHE_TOKENS to true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved time and space requirements as compared to earlier
versions - regardless of the setting of CACHE_TOKENS.

Performance has improved roughly 10% (maybe even a little more).
Space requirements have reduced approximately 30%.

It is now possible to generate a Java parser whose class file is
only 28K in size.  To do this, run JavaCC on Java1.1noLA.jj with
options ERROR_REPORTING=false and CACHE_TOKENS=true.

And over the next few months, there is still places where space
and time can be trimmed!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The token_mask arrays are completely gone and replaced by bit
vectors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nested switch statements have been flattened.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the outputting of code to generate a method

    jjCheckNAddStates(int i)

calls to which are generated, but not the method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Generating the `static' keyword for the backup method of the
UCode*.java files when STATIC flag is set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre6 (as compared to version 0.7pre5)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Extended the generated CharStream classes with a method to adjust the
line and column numbers for the beginning of a token.  Look at the C++
grammar in the distribution to see an example usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the JavaCC front-end so that error messages are given with line
numbers relative to the original .jjt file if the .jj file is generated
by pre-processing using jjtree.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed support for old deprecated features:

. IGNORE_IN_BNF can no longer be used.  Until this version, you
  would get a deprecated warning message if you did use it.

. The extra {} in TOKEN specifications can no longer be used.  Until
  this version, you would get a deprecated warning message if your
  did use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ParseError is no longer supported.  It is now ParseException.  Please
delete the existing generated files for ParseError and ParseException.
The right ParseException will automatically get regenerated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Completed step 1 in getting rid of the token mask arrays.  This
occupies space and is also somewhat inefficient.  Essentially,
replaced all "if" statements that test a token mask entry with
faster "switch" statements.  The token mask array still exist for
error reporting - but they will be removed in the next step (in
the next release).  As a result, we have noticed improved parser
speeds (upto 10% for the Java grammar).

As a consequence of doing step 1, but not step 2, the size of the
generated parser has increased a small amount.  When step 2 is
completed, the size of the generated parser will go down to be even
smaller than what it was before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cache tokens one step ahead during parsing for performance reasons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Made the static token mask fields "final".  Note that the token
mask arrays will go away in the next release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java 1.1 grammar was corrected to allow interfaces nested within
blocks.  The JavaCC grammar was corrected to fix a bug in its
handling of the ">>>=" operator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the optimizations of the lexical analyzer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many changes have been made to JJTree.  See the JJTree release
notes for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre5 (as compared to version 0.7pre4)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug with TOKEN_MGR_DECLS introduced in 0.7pre4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Enhanced JavaCC input grammar to allow JavaCC reserved words in
Java code (such as actions).  This too was disallowed in 0.7pre4
only and has been rectified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The JavaCC+JJTree grammar is now being offered to our users.  You
can find it in the examples directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed an array index out of bounds bug in the parser - that sometimes
can happen when a non-terminal can expand to more than 100 other
non-terminals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in generating parsers with USER_CHAR_STREAM set to true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Created an alternate Java 1.1 grammar in which lookaheads have been
modified to minimize the space requirements of the generated
parser.  See the JavaGrammars directory under the examples directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Provided instructions on how you can make your own grammars space
efficient (until JavaCC is improved to do this).  See the
JavaGrammars directory under the examples directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated all examples to make them current.  Some examples had become
out of date due to newer versions of JavaCC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated the VHDL example - Chris Grimm made a fresh contribution.
This seems to be a real product quality example now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed bugs in the Obfuscator example that has started being used
for real obfuscation by some users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The token manager class is non-final (this was a bug).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many changes have been made to JJTree.  See the JJTree release
notes for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed all token manager optimization bugs that we know about.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed all UNICODE lexing bugs that we know about.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed an array index out of bounds bug in the token manager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre4 (as compared to version 0.7pre3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The only significant change for this version is that we incorporated
the Java grammar into the JavaCC grammar.  The JavaCC front end is
therefore able to parse the entire grammar file intelligently rather
than simple ignore the actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre3 (as compared to version 0.7pre2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

WE HAVE NOT ADDED ANY MAJOR FEATURES TO JAVACC FOR THIS PRERELEASE.
WE'VE FOCUSED MAINLY ON BUG FIXES.  BUT HERE IS WHAT HAS CHANGED:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the JavaCC license agreement to allow redistributions of example
grammars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a couple of bugs in the JavaCC grammar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed an obscure bug that caused spurious '\r's to be generated
on Windows machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed the generated *CharStream classes to take advantage of the
STATIC flag setting.  With this (like the token manager and parser)
the *CharStream class also will have all the methods and variables to
be static with STATIC flag.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A new option OPTIMIZE_TOKEN_MANAGER is introduced. It defaults to
true.  When this option is set, optimizations for the TokenManager, in
terms of size *and* time are performed.

This option is automatically set to false if DEBUG_TOKEN_MANAGER is
set to true.

The new option OPTIMIZE_TOKEN_MANAGER might do some unsafe
optimization that can cause your token manager not to compile or run
properly. While we don't expect this to happen that much, in case it
happens, just turn off the option so that those optimizations will not
happen and you can continue working. Also, if this happens, please
send us the grammar so we can analyze the problem and fix JavaCC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A String-valued option OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is implemented. This can be
used to instruct JavaCC to generate all the code files in a particular
directory.  By default, this is set to user.dir.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a minor bug (in 0.7pre2) in that the specialToken field was not
being set before a lexical action for a TOKEN type reg. exp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a toString method to the Token class to return the image.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre2 (as compared to version 0.7pre1)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AS USUAL, KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A PRERELEASE THAT WE HAVE NOT
TESTED EXTENSIVELY.  THERE ARE A FEW KNOWN BUGS THAT ARE STILL PRESENT
IN THIS VERSION.  QUALITY CONTROL FOR PRERELEASES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER THAN STABLE RELEASES - I.E., WE DON'T MIND THE PRESENCE OF BUGS
THAT WE WOULD FEEL EMBARASSED ABOUT IN STABLE RELEASES.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Main feature release for 0.7pre2 is a completely redone JJTree.  It
now bootstraps itself.  See the JJTree release notes for more
information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Error recovery constructs have been modified a bit from 0.7pre1.  The
parser methods now throw only ParseException by default.  You can now
specify a "throws" clause with your non-terminals to add other
exceptions to this list explicitly.  Please see the help web page at:

   http://www.suntest.com/JavaCCBeta/newerrorhandling.html

for complete information on error recovery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A new Java grammar improved for performance in the presence of very
complex expressions is now included.  This is NewJava1.1.jj.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

More optimizations for the size of the token manager's java and class
files.  The generated .java files are about 10-15% smaller that
0.7pre1 (and 40-45%) smaller compared to 0.6. The class files (with
-O) are about 20% smaller compared to 0.6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The parser size has been decreased.  The current optimizations affect
grammars that have small amounts of non-1 lookaheads.  For example the
generated code for the Java grammar has now reduced by 10%.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Extended the Token class to introduce a new factory function that
takes the token kind and returns a new Token object. This is done to
facilitate creating Objects of subclasses of Token based on the kind.
Look at the generated file Token.java for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The restriction on the input size (to be < 2 gbytes) for the token
manager is gone.  Now the lexer can tokenize any size input (no
limit).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed all the refrences to System.out.println in the *CharStream
classes.  Now all these are thrown as Error objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a very old problem with giving input from System.in. Previously
for the EOF, you needed to give  or  more than once. But now it is
not required any more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a few codegeneration bugs (that give java compiler errors) from
0.7pre1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.7pre1 (as compared to version 0.6.1)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This version is experimental.  Please do not expect this version to
be as robust as version 0.6.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The main feature for this new version is error recovery.  We have laid
the foundations for error recovery in this version.  Things will
continue to improve.  Please see the help web page at:

   http://www.suntest.com/JavaCCBeta/newerrorhandling.html

for complete information on error recovery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Deprecated syntax from Version 0.5 now causes a warning message.  So
far, we have been quietly processing the old syntax, now you will be
notified if you still have those constructs in your grammars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Streamlined the TokenManager code. The java file generated is now
about 30% smaller than before. The class files (with -O option) are
about 10-15% smaller.  The execution time is also reduced by 8-12%.
(all the numbers are for typical grammars)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Parser methods are declared to throw "Exception", and not "ParseError".

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Two new exceptions have been added - TokenMgrError for token manager
errors and ParseException for parser errors.  The exception ParseError
is now deprecated.  It is still generated to maintain backward
compatibility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The previous scheme for customization of error messages is gone.  The
previous scheme required you to subclass the parser and/or the token
manager to customize error messages.  Now you have to modify the
method "getMessage" within the class ParseException.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added the try-catch-finally syntax of Java to facilitate error recovery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a method generateParseException to facilitate error recovery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed *all* System.out.println statements from the TokenManager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed two very minor bugs - one with MORE and EOF and another one with
> 7bit characters starting a complex (non-string literal) regular
expression.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified getNextToken of the token manager (not the parser) not to
throw any exception any more. It only throws (subclasses of) Error
which need not be mentioned in the declaration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Got rid of the variables that were being used to customize error
reporting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The LexicalError method is not there in the TokenManager class
anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6.1 (as compared to version 0.6)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not accept input from standard input any more.  Now all JavaCC
input must come from files.  The reason for this is that the name of
the file is necessary for a lot of our advanced bookkeeping, in
keeping the tools well integrated, and also for the purpose of a
forthcoming feature - emacs compatible error messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The README file has been updated to reflect this version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaCC now generates jjtree.reset(); into the generated ReInit
methods when the grammar file has been processed earlier by JJTree.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6 (as compared to version 0.6(Beta2))

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug with the generated lexer when a string literal token which
is a prefix of another string literal token occurs just before EOF in
the input.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed an IGNORE_CASE bug caused due to a mismatch between JDK 1.0.2
and JDK 1.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Indented the generated lexer code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6(Beta2) (as compared to version 0.6(Beta1))

-------------------------------------------------------------------

JJTree has significantly improved.  See the JJTree releasenotes for
more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug that caused comments immediately before productions to
not get inserted into the generated code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in lexical analyzer generation for rules of the form:

       (("a")*)+

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in lexical analyzer code generation with IGNORE_CASE
option/attribute for cases when there are character ranges given in
lowercase. The bug was that for such cases the uppercase versions were
not being accepted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the ASCII_CharStream class to do the correct column number
calculations for tabs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug with one string literal token being a prefix of another
string literal token (e.g., "final" and "finally"), with IGNORE_CASE
attribute or option set. The bug was that the generated code had
unreachable statements which java compiler didn't like.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed the interpretation and the corresponding implementation of the
IGNORE_CASE option and attribute. A specification like

    TOKEN [IGNORE_CASE] :
    { 
       < STUFF: (~["a"-"z"])+ >
    }

will now mean

    TOKEN  :
    { 
       < STUFF: (~["a"-"z", "A"-"Z"])+ >
    }

previously, it meant

    TOKEN [IGNORE_CASE] :
    { 
       < STUFF: (["\u0000"-"\u0060", "\u007b"-"\u00ff"])+ >
    }

(so, if you look carefully, "a"-"z" will also get added, which is not
very intuitive)

Intuitively with the new scheme, ~["a"-"z"] with IGNORE_CASE stands
for any non-alphabetic character.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed the lexical error message to print the prefix that was already
consumed when a lexical error occurs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed printing <EOF> in lexical error when the input character is 0,
instead now it explicitly checks to see if an <EOF> has indeed occured
when printing Encountered : <EOF>

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved parse error messages when ERROR_REPORTING is set to false.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Calls to getNextToken are now tracked and traced when DEBUG_PARSER
is set to true.  Previously, this was not happening - so JAVACODE
productions could not be debugged easily.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The install script has been improved further by the JInstall
developer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added some new examples - DU contributed by John D. Ramsdell, the
Lookahead examples used to illustrate the various Lookahead concepts,
and an transformation example to illustrate "passing through" of
tokens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified some existing examples as follows:

. Updated the Java 1.1 grammar to include nested classes/interfaces
  within interfaces; and also modified its CastExpression expansions
  to expand to Type so that any actions associated with Type get
  automatically invoked (this was thanks to Bill Foote).

. The Interpreter example has been improved to use the new features
  of JJTree.  It also includes read and write statements now.

. Simple1.jj in the SimpleExamples directory has been improved to
  accept '\r's in addition to '\n's.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Download is now also available in ftp form.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6(Beta1) (as compared to version 0.6.-8)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved the error detection algorithm to get a complete list of
expected tokens in all cases.  There are situations when a lot of
complex lookaheads are used when some expected tokens are overlooked
in earlier versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the generated CharStream files which was giving problems
for large tokens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Reordered the generation of code in the parser to cause the boilerplate
code to be generated after the actual parser code.  This allows us to
customize the boilerplate code and reduce its size and complexity for
simple grammars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The lookahead ambiguity checking algorithm has been extended to
consider the existence of nested semantic lookahead.  Hence, fewer
warnings are produced in the presence of semantic lookahead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added two new options DEBUG_PARSER and DEBUG_LOOKAHEAD.  The option
DEBUG will soon be deleted.  But for the time being, DEBUG is
equivalent to DEBUG_PARSER.  DEBUG_PARSER provides just parser debugging.
DEBUG_LOOKAHEAD provides detailed lookahead debugging in addition to
parser debugging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Implemented a new boolean option COMMON_TOKEN_ACTION which defaults to
false.  When this option is set, the getNextToken method of the
generated lexer will make a call

       CommonTokenAction(matchedToken);

before returning a token. This method can be implemented by the user
in the TOKEN_MGR_DECLS. Its signature is :

       void CommonTokenAction(Token t)

One of the examples that I can think of where this feature is useful
is the calculation of line and column numbers when you have #line
directives (like a C/C++ preprocessed file). So you can maintain the
line and column numbers in the lexer seperately and just before
returning a token, you can adjust the line and column numbers so that
your error messages will be more precise.

Note : a) if the STATIC option is set to true, this method needs to be
declared to be a static method and b) this method is called *ONLY* for
TOKEN kind tokens and *NOT* for SKIP/MORE/SPECIAL_TOKEN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

New grammars including a Java 1.1 grammar and a couple of HTML
grammars have been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6.-8 (as compared to version 0.6.-9)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The name of the tools have been changed.  Essentially, the tools will
now be distributed under the official name "Java Compiler Compiler".
The short name for this tool is JavaCC.  While the old names will
still work for stuff such as the mailing list, web pages, etc., we
encourage all of you to move over to the new name as soon as possible.

The main change for you will be that the program name "jack" changes
to "javacc".  The package COM.sun.labs.jack changes to COM.sun.labs.javacc.
The tree builder preprocessor (originally beanstalk) is now called
jjtree, and the old JackDoc is now called jjdoc.  The preferred file
extension for grammar input files is now ".jj".

The reason for the name change is that this tool has become far more
successful than we ever expected.  We are doing everything to make this
a professional tool and a formally registered name is one aspect of
this process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Beanstalk and JackDoc have been integrated with Jack into one release
although they are still invoked as different main programs with their
changed names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

All private variables and classes of the generated parser is now
prefixed with "jj" or "JJ".  If you avoid using names starting with
"jj"/"JJ", you will not clash with the generated variables.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java grammar and the JavaCC input grammar did not allow form feeds.
They have been extended to allow them now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some quirks in semantic lookahead have been fixed.  Lookahead specifications
are now allowed anywhere in the grammar (just like actions).  In summary,
semantic lookahead is now evaluated during other lookaheads.  A variable
"lookingAhead" is provided for you to fine-tune your semantic lookahead.

Example:

void foo():
{}
{
  A()
|
  B()
}

void A():
{}
{ LOOKAHEAD({isType(getToken(1)}) "a" "b" }

void B():
{}
{ "a" "b" }

In this example, when foo() is parsed, A() is selected if the next token
(that must match an "a") is a type.  Otherwise B() is selected.  That is
because during the choice determination between A() and B(), the semantic
lookahead appears within the single token lookahead for the A() | B()
choice point.

Suppose this example is modified to:

void foo():
{}
{
  A()
|
  B()
}

void A():
{}
{ "a" LOOKAHEAD({isType(getToken(1)}) "b" }

void B():
{}
{ "a" "b" }

In this case we are interested in choosing A() if the second token (that
matches "b") is a type.  In this case the choice A() is taken since there
is no semantic lookahead within a lookahead of 1 token (the default) at
the choice point for A() | B().  After A() is selected, there will be a
parse error if "b" does not happen to be a type.

Now consider this last modification that illustrates an important feature:

void foo():
{}
{
  LOOKAHEAD(2)
  A()
|
  B()
}

void A():
{}
{ "a" LOOKAHEAD({isType(getToken(1)}) "b" }

void B():
{}
{ "a" "b" }

In this case, the lookahead for the choice point A() | B() has been increased
to 2 and therefore includes the semantic lookahead.  Hence the choice is
taken properly.  LOOKAHEAD(2) could be replaced by LOOKAHEAD(A()) with the
same effect.


A new document "LookaheadTutorial.txt" is being prepared and an incomplete
version is available in the doc directory.  This will eventually provide a
clear description of all issues of LOOKAHEAD.

Special thanks to an example from Doug South that illustrated what we
needed to do to improve semantic lookahead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

For a LOOKAHEAD(...) with only semantic lookahead, the syntactic lookahead
amount defaults to 0.  Previously this defaulted to the global lookahead
amount.  This is a more intuitive default with our new extended semantic
lookahead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIAL_TOKEN processing has been implemented.  This means that any
regular expression defined to be a SPECIAL_TOKEN (typically comments)
may be accessed in a special manner from user actions in the parser.
This allows these tokens to be recovered during parsing while at the
same time these tokens do not participate in the parsing.

Details:

The class Token now has an additional field:

   Token specialToken;

This field points to the special token immediately prior to the current
token (special or otherwise).  If the token immediately prior to the
current token is a regular token (and not a special token), then this
field is set to null.  The "next" field's of regular tokens continue
to have the same meaning - i.e., they point to the next regular token
except in the case of the EOF token where the "next" field is null.
The "next" field of special tokens point to the special token immediately
following the current token.  If the token immediately following the
current token is a regular token, the "next" field is set to null.

This is clarified by the following example.  Suppose you wish to
print all special tokens prior to the regular token "t" (but only those
that are after the regular token before "t"):

  if (t.specialToken == null) return;
    // The above statement determines that there are no special tokens
    // and returns control to the caller.
  Token tmp_t = t.specialToken;
  while (tmp_t.specialToken != null) tmp_t = tmp_t.specialToken;
    // The above line walks back the special token chain until it
    // reaches the first special token after the previous regular
    // token.
  while (tmp_t != null) {
    System.out.println(tmp_t.image);
    tmp_t = tmp_t.next;
  }
    // The above loop now walks the special token chain in the forward
    // direction printing them in the process.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The parser generator has itself been bootstrapped to take advantage
of the SPECIAL_TOKEN implementation.  What this means is that any
comments in your grammar input file will be retained in your generated
files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to being able to specify a global IGNORE_CASE, now it can
also be specified at the token specification level.  More specifically,
by placing a "[IGNORE_CASE]" immediately after TOKEN, SPECIAL_TOKEN,
SKIP, or MORE, the case is ignored in all regular expressions in that
particular token specification.

Example:

TOKEN[IGNORE_CASE]:
{
  "html" | "li" | "ul"
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A single token specification may now describe multiple lexical states.
Previously the syntax was <lexical_state_name> to associate a particular
state with the specification.  Now you can provide a list of state
names separated by commas.  For example:

<LSTATE1, LSTATE2>
SKIP:
{
  " "
}

says skip spaces (" ") in states LSTATE1 and LSTATE2.

You can also use the wild card character "*" to include all lexical
states.  For example,

<*>
SKIP:
{
  " "
}

says skip spaces (" ") in all lexical states.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The declaration "int EOF = 0;" has been added to the ...Constants.java
file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Two new variables are available for use in lexical actions :

   int lengthOfMatch - lenght of the current match (after last match).
         Note that this does not include any MORE's that have been
         matched after the last TOKEN/SKIP.
         Read only.

   Token matchedToken - this is available to user actions in TOKEN
         as well as SPECIAL_TOKEN actions.
         Read/Write.

The variable matchedPos that used to be avaialable is not available
anymore for use in actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a convenience, when USER_TOKEN_MANAGER is set to true, a token can
be specified as simply <NAME>.  No definition is required.  However,
all tokens that are important must have a label otherwise it will not
be possible to refer to the index of that token from the user written
token manager.  A warning message is provided when labels are not
provided.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a bug due to which non-terminals with non-ASCII characters
were not processed correctly.  This bug has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a new option DEBUG_TOKEN_MANAGER to debug the generated token
manager. If this option is set to true, the generated token manager
will provide debug information while doing lexical analysis. This
information includes what kind of token is currently matched, what are
the possible longer matches, the current input character and the
lexical state name.

When this option is set, very detailed debugging information is
produced, therefore it is best to use this option with very small test
inputs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

When DEBUG is true, tracing is also performed during LOOKAHEAD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a warning when a char > 0xff is seen in a regular expression
specificiation and neither the JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE nor the
UNICODE_INPUT option is set to true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the NullPointerException in lexical actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the ArrayStore exception in *CharStream classes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the duplicate case label error with the IGNORE_CASE option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*******************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6.-9 (as compared to version 0.6.-10)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The major change for this version is the addition of lexical states.
This is describe in detail later.  However, as a consequence of
doing this, a large portion of the Jack code that handled the lexical
analyzer generation has either been modified or substantially
rewritten.  This could cause new bugs to appear or even old bugs
to reappear.  We have run the new Jack through a regression suite,
but can never be sure.  We are a little more lax about these minor
versions than we will be for major versions that are announced to
the entire public.  The addition of lexical states is upward
compatible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again (as in 0.6.-10), we will have a version skew between the
tools - Jack, Beanstalk, and JackDoc all operate on different versions
of the grammars.  We anticipate making a general release numbered
0.5.5 (which will be based on 0.6.-9) within the next 2 to 3 weeks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Jack and Beanstalk are still being released separately.  Hopefully,
0.5.5 will be a single joint release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

All options may now be placed either in the Jack source file, or as
command line arguments.  Options are no longer required to be
upper-case.  They are now case insensitive.  There are some alternate
ways of entering options from the command line (alternate to
-option=value).  You can also say "-option:value".  If the option is
boolean valued, then "-option=true" can be shortened to "-option"
(e.g., -STATIC) and "-option=false" can be shortened to "-NOoption"
(e.g., -NOSTATIC).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two main programs provided.  One is called Main.class and
terminates execution with System.exit.  The return code indicates
success/failure of the parser generation.  The other is called
MacMain.class and terminates by executing return statements.  The main
program of MacMain.class can be called from your other Java programs
if you wish to integrate Jack with something else.  The name MacMain
was chosen because this main program was created due to System.exit
not working properly on the Mac's.  The source code for these main
programs is provided as part of the release to facilitate any special
usage requirements of your Java environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following options have been added:

IGNORE_CASE: This is a boolean valued option that defaults to false.
If set to true, then the generated lexical analyzer ignores the case
of letters.  Please see the Java Language Specification, sections
20.5.20 and 20.5.21 for complete details on what this means for
general UNICODE characters.

The following are integer options that control the thoroughness of the
ambiguity checking performed by Jack.  Increasing these numbers can
cause Jack to spend a very long time in performing ambiguity checking
and possibly even run out of memory.  So be careful when setting these
to large values.

CHOICE_AMBIGUITY_CHECK: This integer option has a default value of 2.
This is the number of tokens considered in checking choices of the
form "A | B | ..." for ambiguity.  For example, if there is a common
two token prefix for both A and B, but no common three token prefix,
(assume this option is set to 3) then Jack can tell you to use a
lookahead of 3 for disambiguation purposes.  And if A and B have a
common three token prefix, then Jack only tell you that you need to
have a lookahead of 3 *OR MORE*.  Increasing this can give you more
comprehensive ambiguity information at the cost of more processing
time.

OTHER_AMBIGUITY_CHECK: This integer option has a default value of 1.
This is the number of tokens considered in checking all other kinds of
choices (i.e., of the forms "(A)*", "(A)+", and "(A)?") for ambiguity.
This takes more time to do than the choice checking, and hence the
default value is set to 1 rather than 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

"<<", >>", ">>>", ">>=", etc. were tokens in earlier versions of Jack.
This caused Jack to give error messages on inputs that looked like
"<foo: <bar>>".  Now, these are no longer tokens.  If these appear
within Java code, they will be treated as multiple tokens and written
to the output file in the same manner (so it will reappear exactly as
is).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The methods "enable_tracing" and "disable_tracing" may now be called
even with a parser generated with option DEBUG set to false.  In this
case, these methods are no-ops, but they allow you to easily recompile
without having to remove the calls to these methods.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java grammar now allows semicolons at the same level as top-level
class and interface declarations (as per the JLS).  It seems now that
the Jack Java grammar is superior to all others I know.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A bug involving the processing of a range including \u0000 has been
fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The lexical analyzer (or token manager) has been further optimized
for use with non-ASCII (i.e., UNICODE) characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The parser has now been optimized significantly for productions that
use a lookahead of 1 (with or without semantic lookahead).  In
addition, the parser has also been optimized to a lesser extent for
productions that use a lookahead of 2 or more.  As a consequence of
these optimizations and resulting algorithm changes, the huge array
(of size 10000) is no longer generated and the problem of the
array index out of bounds exception no longer exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a new method GetSuffix to the CharStream interface and its
implementation to the CharStream classes generated by Jack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified the Lexical Error message in case of <EOF>. to say
Encountered : <EOF>.  Previously it used to print the last matched
character.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently lexical state names and token labels share the same name
space.  Therefore the same name cannot be used for both a lexical
state and a token label.  Since there is one standard lexical state
called DEFAULT, therefore there cannot be any label with the same
name.  This causes a non-upward-compatible situation in this case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

LEXICAL STATES AND LEXICAL ACTIONS

(This is an upward compatible change except for the use of DEFAULT
 to earlier versions of Jack)

The Jack lexical specification is organized into a set of "lexical
states".  Each lexical state is named with an identifier.  There is a
standard lexical state called DEFAULT.  The generated lexical analyzer
is at any moment in one of these lexical states.  When the lexical
analyzer is initialized, it starts off in the DEFAULT state, by default.
The starting lexical state can also be specified as a parameter while
constructing a lexer object.

Each lexical state contains an ordered list of regular expressions
(possibly labeled as before), this order is derived from the order of
occurrence in the input file.  There are four kinds of regular
expressions: SKIP, MORE, TOKEN, and SPECIAL_TOKEN.

As mentioned above, the lexical analyzer is in exactly one state at
any moment.  At this moment, the lexical analyzer only considers the
regular expressions defined in this state for matching purposes (using
the same algorithm as before - longest and earliest match).  After a
match, one can now specify an action to be executed as well as a new
lexical state to move to.  If a new lexical state is not specified,
the lexical analyzer remains in the current state.

The syntax for introducing regular expressions is:

  RegularExpressionProduction ::=
    [ "<" IDENTIFIER ">" ] Kind ":"
    [ "{" "}" ]  // we do away with this but make it optional for upward compatibility.
    "{"
      RegularExpressionSpec ( "|" RegularExpressionSpec )*
    "}"

  Kind ::=
    "SKIP" | "MORE" | "TOKEN" | "SPECIAL_TOKEN" | "IGNORE_IN_BNF"

  RegularExpressionSpec ::=
    RegularExpression [ "{" java_declarations_and_code "}" ] [ ":" IDENTIFIER ]

The grammar entities "RegularExpression", "java_declarations_and_code",
and "IDENTIFIER" are exactly the same as in Jack 0.6.-10.

You may still introduce regular expressions inline in the grammar as
before, and these regular expressions are considered to be part of the
DEFAULT state.

As mentioned above, all older Jack files will continue to work with
the new version of Jack - it is fully upward compatible.  However, there
are two pieces of "deprecated" syntax (which you should eventually change
to new syntax).  Jack will eventually flag this as deprecated usage, and
then later on disallow it completely.  These two cases are:

1. The "{}" at the beginning of regular expression productions have no
   use and we are now getting rid of it.  As the above syntax shows,
   it will be currently retained as optional.

2. The reserved word "SKIP" replaces "IGNORE_IN_BNF".  If you use
   "IGNORE_IN_BNF" in your Jack file, it will be treated like a "SKIP"
   declaration.  Note that the semantics of SKIP are the same as the
   old IGNORE_IN_BNF, so existing grammars will continue to work in
   exactly the same way.

The kind "SPECIAL_TOKEN" is for tokens such as comments that you want
to do special processing on.  This has not been implemented in 0.6.-9,
but will be implemented in the near future.  For the time being,
"SPECIAL_TOKEN" will work in the same way as "SKIP".

The lexical state of all the regular expressions in a regular
expression production is the identifier that appears within angular
brackets before SKIP, MORE, etc.  If this ("<...>") is not present,
then the lexical state of of all the regular expressions in the
regular expression production is DEFAULT.  All the regular expressions
in the regular expression production are of the specified kind (SKIP,
MORE, TOKEN, SPECIAL_TOKEN).

The kind specifies what to do when a regular expression has been
successfully matched:

SKIP: Simply throw away the matched string.
MORE: Continue (to whatever the next state is) taking the matched
      string along.  This string will be a prefix of the new matched
      string.
TOKEN: Create a token using the matched string and send it to the
       parser (or any caller).
SPECIAL_TOKEN: TBD (for the time being, this is the same as SKIP)
IGNORE_IN_BNF: Deprecated.  Same as SKIP.

Whenever the end of file <EOF> is detected, it causes the creation
of an <EOF> token (regardless of the current state of the lexical
analyzer).  However, if an <EOF> is detected in the middle of a match
for a regular expression, or immediately after a MORE regular expression
has been matched, an error is reported.

The regular expressions in a regular expression production are written
as regular expression specifications.  Each regular expression
specification has (in addition to the regular expression itself) some
arbitrary Java code that will be executed on successful recognition of
the regular expression (this is optional), and also the new state to
go to which is also optional.

After the regular expression is matched, the Java code (the lexical
action) is executed. All the variables (and methods) declared in the
TOKEN_MGR_DECLS region (see below) are available here for use. In
addition, the following variables and methods of the lexer are also
available for use:

   StringBuffer image - this contains the characters that have been
                        matched so far (after the last SKIP/TOKEN).
                        Read/Write.

   int matchedPos -     the length of the suffix (of image) that is
                        matched by the current RE (excluding any
                        MORE's that are alreadymatched before this
                        RE).
                        Preferably Read-Only.

   int curLexState -    index of the current lexical state.
                        Preferably Read-Only.

   inputStream -        The input stream of appropriate type ASCII or
                        ASCII_UCodeESC or UCode or UCode_UCodeESC
                        CharStream depending on the UNICODE and
                        JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE option setting. The stream
                        is currently at the last character read for
                        this match. So methods like getEndLine,
                        getEndColumn can be used to get the line and
                        column number info for the current match.
                        Read-Only.

   Token matchedToken - Available ONLY for actions with TOKEN kind
                        regular expressions. This is the token object
                        that will be returned to the caller (after the
                        action).
                        Read/Write.

   void SwitchTo(int) - A method to switch to a new lexical state.
                        This method can be called with the state name
                        which you want the lexer to change to.

Immediately after this, the lexical analyzer changes state to that
specified by <IDENTIFIER>.  If <IDENTIFIER> is missing, it stays in
the current state.

After that the action specified by the kind of the regular expression
is taken (SKIP, MORE, ... ). If the kind is TOKEN, the matched token
is returned.

Lexical actions have access to a set of class level declarations.
These declarations are introduced within the Jack file using the
following syntax:

token_manager_decls ::=
  "TOKEN_MGR_DECLS" ":"
  "{" java_declarations_and_code "}"

These declarations are accessible from all lexical actions.

Changing Lexical States Using Java Code :
---------------------------------------

A method

          void SwitchTo(int lexState)

is generated as a member of the lexer class. This can be used to
switch to a new lexical state without using the : <STATENAME> syntax.
It should be used with caution, especially if you plan to call it in
parser actions because the parser may have already looked ahead a few
tokens before the action is executed.

EXAMPLES
--------

Example 1: Comments

SKIP :
{
  "/*" : WithinComment
}

<WithinComment> SKIP :
{
  "*/" : DEFAULT
}

<WithinComment> MORE :
{
  <~[]>
}


Example 2: String Literals with actions to print the length of the string:

TOKEN_MGR_DECLS :
{
  int stringSize;
}

MORE :
{
  "\"" {stringSize = 0;} : WithinString
}

<WithinString> TOKEN :
{
  <STRLIT: "\""> {System.out.println("Size = " + stringSize);} : DEFAULT
}

<WithinString> MORE :
{
  <~["\n","\r"]> {stringSize++;}
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------

MODIFICATIONS IN VERSION 0.6.-10 (as compared to version 0.5)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

INCONSISTENCY ALERT: Intermediate versions (numbered x.y.-z) may
be inconsistent.  For example, 0.6.-10 has an improved grammar for
Jack input files, but JackDoc has not been modified.  Please ignore
such inconsistencies which we will try to keep minimal.  Major
releases (numbered x.y) will always be consistent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The array index out of bounds problem (in scan_token) has not
yet been fixed!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some long file names have been shortened to facilitate using Jack
on Mac machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

File generation now starts after most front end error checks have
been performed.  Very soon "most" in the previous statement will
become "all".  After which time, we may make the Jack front end
source code available with certain usage restrictions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Jack 0.5 allowed private tokens (declared with #) to be used in
grammar specifications.  Now this is detected and an error reported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A warning previously reported as an error has been fixed to be a
warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Calls to System.exit(...) have been replaced by "return" to facilitate
usage on the Mac.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Jack's internal generation algorithm has been modified.  If you peek
at the Jack generated parsers, you will notice the difference.
Currently, things work just the same as before, but we have set the
stage for further improvements which will use this new framework.
This includes optimizations for single token lookahead, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Jack's input tokens now have the same definition as in the Java
language specification but includes the following additional reserved
words: options, LOOKAHEAD, PARSER_BEGIN, PARSER_END, JAVACODE,
IGNORE_IN_BNF, TOKEN, and EOF.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The long comments (/*...*/) in the Jack input files did not work
properly when the '*/' was immediately preceded by an odd number of
'*'s.  This bug has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The type specification of non-terminal declarations (on the left-hand
side of a production) can now be any Java type specifications.
Previously there were a few restrictions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The LHS of the optional assignment in tokens and non-terminals can now
be any legal Java LHS that does not begin with "(".  Previously, the
LHS was restricted to be a single identifier.  The restriction
regarding "(" will be removed in future versions.  Therefore, you can
have things like:

  a.b = NT(...)
  a[x+y].c(1,2).d = NT(...)
  etc.

but you cannot have something like:

  (a).b = NT(...)

because is starts with "(".

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The lookahead repertoire of Jack has been augmented with semantic
lookahead.  Apart from the default lookahead (which we highly
recommend that you set to 1), Jack now has three methods of specifying
lookahead at the various choice points.  These are (the first two
already existed):

1. Fixed lookahead: Here you specify the number of tokens to
   lookahead, and this overrides the default lookahead amount.  An
   example of its use is "LOOKAHEAD(5)" to specify that a lookahead of
   5 tokens must be used at the current choice point instead of the
   default amount.

2. Syntactic lookahead: We used to call this "variable lookahead".
   Here you specify an expansion to use in the lookahead process that
   is different from the expansion to be parsed (which is the one that
   would have been used if this were not present).  An example of its
   use is LOOKAHEAD( ( "abstract" | "final" | "public" )* "class" ).
   In this case, the lookahead succeeds if the next set of tokens in
   the input stream are a sequence of "abstract", "final", and
   "public" followed by "class".

3. Semantic lookahead: Here you specify a boolean expression.  The
   lookahead succeeds if this expression evaluates to true.  An
   example of its use is:

   LOOKAHEAD( { getToken(1).kind == IDENTIFIER && isType(getToken(1).image) } )

   The boolean expression is placed within braces just like actions
   are.  In this case, the lookahead succeeds if the next token is an
   identifier that designates a type.  (Actually, this is not entirely
   true, there is a syntactic lookahead that is also performed.  See
   below for lookahead combinations and defaults.)

The three kinds of lookahead can be combined together according to the
following syntax:

LOOKAHEAD ( integer_literal , Jack_expansion , { boolean_expression } )

At least one of the three (in the comma separated list must be
present).  If you don't want to specialize lookahead, simply don't
specify it and the default action will be taken - which is to use the
default lookahead amount on the expansion to be parsed.  When a
lookahead specification is present, its behavior is detailed below on
a case by case basis:

a. The "lookahead expansion" is specified by Jack_expansion in the
   above syntax.  If Jack_expansion is not present in the lookahead
   specification, "lookahead expansion" defaults to the expansion to
   be parsed.  Also, if the boolean_expression is not present, it
   defaults to "true".

b. If the integer_literal is not present, it defaults to either (i)
   the default lookahead amount if Jack_expansion is not present, or
   (ii) Integer.MAX_VALUE if Jack_expansion is present.  This is how
   "infinite" lookahead is achieved when Jack_expansion is present.
   If the integer_literal is 0, then no syntactic lookahead is
   performed.

Examples:

1. Default behavior: If there is no explicit lookahead specification
   at a choice point, it is as we have the following:

   LOOKAHEAD(default_lookahead_amount, expansion_to_be_parsed, {true}).

2. Only an integer literal is specified as in (from the Java grammar):

   LOOKAHEAD(2)
   StaticInitializer()

   Then two tokens of lookahead is used to determine lookahead.  With
   all the defaults, the above lookahead specification is:

   LOOKAHEAD(2, StaticInitializer(), {true})

3. Only an expansion is present as in (from the Java grammar):

   LOOKAHEAD( ( "abstract" | "final" | "public" )* "class" )
   ClassDeclaration()

   The above lookahead expands to include all defaults to be:

   LOOKAHEAD(2147483647, ( "abstract" | "final" | "public" )* "class", {true} )

4. Only a semantic specification is present as in the earlier example:

   LOOKAHEAD( { getToken(1).kind == IDENTIFIER && isType(getToken(1).image) } )

   This is equivalent to:

   LOOKAHEAD(default_lookahead_amount, expansion_to_be_parsed,
             { getToken(1).kind == IDENTIFIER && isType(getToken(1).image) } )

   Note here that if you simply have a semantic lookahead specification,
   it is *still* preceded by an implicit syntactic lookahead check.  So
   most probably the check that getToken(1).kind == IDENTIFIER was not
   necessary as in the following use of the above semantic lookahead:

   void expression() :
   {}
   {
     LOOKAHEAD( { isType(getToken(1).image) } )
     castExpression()
   |
     functionCall()
   }

   void castExpression() :
   {}
   {
     <IDENTIFIER> "(" expression() ")"
   }

   So assuming the default lookahead is 1, the above lookahead with defaults
   is:

   LOOKAHEAD(1, castExpression(), { isType(getToken(1).image) } )

   Since the semantic lookahead is performed only if the syntactic lookahead
   succeeds, we are guaranteed that the first lookahead token is indeed an
   identifier.

5. Suppose we do not wish to have a syntactic lookahead performed before
   the semantic lookahead.  We then simply set the lookahead amount to 0
   as in the following example.  This example is the syntax of Jack's
   lookahead itself:

   void lookaheadSpecification() :
   {}
   {
     "LOOKAHEAD" "("
       [ integer_literal() ]
       [ "," ]
       [ expansion() ]
       [ "," ]
       [ "{" expression() "}" ]
     ")"
   }

   As you can see, the problem with this grammar is that it allows all
   sorts of illegal stuff with the (...).  For example it allows
   LOOKAHEAD() and LOOKAHEAD(,,) both of which are illegal.  If you
   try to write the grammar to disallow these cases, the grammar
   becomes rather large and actions have to be repeated at different
   places (try it).  Instead, I could augment the above grammar with
   semantic predicates as follows and I'm done!

   void lookaheadSpecification() :
   {
     boolean atLeastOne = false;
     boolean comma1Reqd = false, comma2Reqd = false;
   }
   {
     "LOOKAHEAD" "("
       [ integer_literal() { comma1Reqd = true; atLeastOne = true; } ]
       [ LOOKAHEAD(0, {comma1Reqd}) "," ]
       [ expansion() { comma2Reqd = true; atLeastOne = true; } ]
       [ LOOKAHEAD(0, {comma2Reqd}) "," ]
       [ LOOKAHEAD(0, {!atLeastOne || getToken(1).kind == LBRACE}) "{" expression() "}" ]
     ")"
   }

   Don't get confused by the two uses of "LOOKAHEAD" above - one is as
   a string and the other is as a reserved word!  This is how Jack
   bootstraps itself.
   If the 0 in the lookahead specifications were omitted, you will get
   a different effect than the one required.

An extra comment has been added to the top of the Java grammar to make
it clear that you may use parsers generated from this grammar in a
manner similar to parsers generated out of your own grammars.  This
is legalese, not technical!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some bugs in the Java grammar that comes with Jack have been fixed:

     .	The single line comment specification has been changed from
		<"//" (~["\n","\r"])* ("\n"|"\r\n")>
	to
		<"//" (~["\n","\r"])* ("\n"|"\r"|"\r\n")>

     .	The /*...*/ comment specification has been changed from
		<"/*" (~["*"])* "*" (~["/"] (~["*"])* "*")* "/">
	to
		<"/*" (~["*"])* "*" ("*" | (~["*","/"] (~["*"])* "*"))* "/">

     .  The right shift operators were wrongly specified to be:

		< RSHIFT: ">>" >
		< RSIGNSHIFT: ">>>" >
		< RSHIFTASSIGN: ">>=" >
		< RSIGNSHIFTASSIGN: ">>>=" >

	They have been corrected to be:

		< RSIGNEDSHIFT: ">>" >
		< RUNSIGNEDSHIFT: ">>>" >
		< RSIGNEDSHIFTASSIGN: ">>=" >
		< RUNSIGNEDSHIFTASSIGN: ">>>=" >
